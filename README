This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3851

Maps <leader>m and <leader>M to cycle through your marks alphabetically and
reverse alphabetically, respectively.

Only cycles through alphabetic marks, though that's easy to change if you edit 
the script.

Requires Vim to be compiled with Python support.
